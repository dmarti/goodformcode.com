# What is this?

With the [recent licensing changes](https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2018/aug/22/commons-clause/) to several [Redis Labs modules](https://redislabs.com/community/licenses/) making them no longer free and open source, GNU/Linux distributions like [Debian](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines) and [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing) are no longer able to ship Redis Labs' version of the affected modules to our users.

As a result we have begun working together to create a [set of module repositories](https://github.com/goodform) forked from prior to the license change. We will maintain changes to these modules under their original open source licenses - applying only free and open fixes and updates.

We are committed to making these available under an open source license permanently, and welcome community involvement.
